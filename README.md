# chromeExtensions
This repository contains chrome extensions I create personally. These can only be used in developer mode and have specific use-cases.

# Notes
- These extensions are provided on an as-is basis with no promise of maintenance or even functionality.
- None of these extensions are affiliated with any brands or companies, they are all personal projects.
